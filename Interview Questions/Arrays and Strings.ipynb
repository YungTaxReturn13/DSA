    "The optimal approach would be to either use a list or a dictionary to act as a record if we have seen a letter before. This way, in the worst case scenario, we would have to go through the list once, leading to a time complexity of O(n). \n",

    "**Improvements**\n",
    "We could also ask whether the string is either ASCII or Unicode. There are far greater # of characters in Unicode vs ASCII (less than 200 for regular ascii and 256 for exte4nded ascii vs in the hundred thousands). Then we can then add a clause in the beginning of our function that checks if our string is greater than that number and immediatley return false. \n",
