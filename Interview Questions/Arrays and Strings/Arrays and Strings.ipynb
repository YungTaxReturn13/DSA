    "# Common Techniques and issues \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that array question and string questions are often interchangable. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Hash Tables \n",
    "\n",
    "If the number of collisions in a hash table are very high, the worst case runtime for searching for an item in a has table is O(n), where n is the number of keys. However, we generally assume a good implementation that keeps collisions to a minimum, in which case the lookup time is O(1). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Dyanmic Arrays\n",
    "The amortized insertion runtime is O(1). Suppose you have an array of size N. We can work backwards to compute how many elements were copied at each capacity increase. Observe that when you increase the array to K elements, the array was perviously have that size. Therefore we had to copy over k/2 elements. Therefore, the total number of copies to insert N elements is roughly N/2 + N/4 + N/8 + ... + 2 + 1 , which is just less than N. This is similar to if oyu had a mile long walk to the store and you walk 0.5 miles, then 0.25, then 0.125 and so on. You will never exceed one mile although you get very close to it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, inserting N elements takes o(N) work total. Each insertion is o(1) on average, even though some insertions take O(n) time in the worst case \n",
    "\n",
    "# String Builder \n",
    "\n",
    "if you had to continually concatentate a letter to a string, on each concatenation, a new copy of the string is created, and the two strings are copied over, character by character. The first iteration requires us to copy x characters. The second iteration requires copying 2x characters. The third iteration requires 3x and so on. The total time therefore is 0(x + 2x + ... + nx) which reduces down to O(xn^2)\n",
    "\n",
    "It is better to use an array to hold the characters and then join them, copying them back to a string only when necessary \n",

    "The optimal approach would be to either use a list or a dictionary to act as a record if we have seen a letter before. This way, in the worst case scenario, we would have to go through the list once, leading to a time complexity of O(n). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Improvements**\n",
    "We could also ask whether the string is either ASCII or Unicode. There are far greater # of characters in Unicode vs ASCII (less than 200 for regular ascii and 256 for exte4nded ascii vs in the hundred thousands). Then we can then add a clause in the beginning of our function that checks if our string is greater than that number and immediatley return false. \n",

    "# String Compression \n",
    "\n",
    "Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters. If the \"compressed\" string would not become smaller than the original string, your method should return hte original string. You can assume the string has onle uppercase and lowercase letters \n",
    "\n",
    "ex) aabcccccaaa -> a2b1c5a3\n",

    "The implementation seems fairly straighforward. We iterate through the string, copying the characters to a new string and counting the repeats. At each iteration, check if the current character is the same as the next character. if not, add its compressed version to the result. This works but remember **when building a string that you will need to repeatedly append to, it is better to use a list and then join**. String join is significantly faster then concatenation because Strings are immutable and can't be changed in place. To alter one, a new representation needs to be created (a concatenation of the two) String concatenation operates in O(n^2). This would mean that the runtime would be O(p + k^2) where p is the size of the original string and k is the number of character sequences. \n",
